# tourguide-ar: a big ol' work in progress

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started

In the project directory, here's what to run:

### `npm install`

You should run this first - it will install all the necessary javascript modules to your local dev folder.
The app won't run until you've done this!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
