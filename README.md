## Getting started

in your terminal, navigate to your projects folder eg `cd Documents/MyProjects`
then run this:

### `git clone https://github.com/Tourguide-ar/Tourguide-ar.git`

now go into the project directory and make NPM install all the necessary modules:

### `cd Tourguide-ar`
### `npm install`

The app won't run until you've done this!


## Running the app

### `npm start`

This runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Building the website

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
